# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Modeling Approaches

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Named Entity Recognition (NER) using both traditional machine learning approaches and deep learning approaches. 

Specifically, it covers:

1. Traditional NER using Conditional Random Fields (CRF).
2. Deep Learning NER using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)
